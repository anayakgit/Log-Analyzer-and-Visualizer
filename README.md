 1. Log Parsing: Counts occurrences of INFO, WARNING, and ERROR from log files.
 2. Visualization: Uses Matplotlib to create bar charts for log severity.
 3. Dynamic Handling: Processes logs dynamically with flexible severity categorization.
 4. OOP Design: Encapsulates logic in a LogProcessor class for modularity.
